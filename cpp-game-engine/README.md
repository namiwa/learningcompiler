# Learning to build game engine from scratch


## Motivation
This documents the beginning of learning game development from scratch. Starting with:

- OpenGL in C++ (restrict to 2D environment)
- Understanding how physics / physics engines work (for 2D space)
- Asset loading (textures & audio)
- tying it all together with an entity control system (somehow??)
